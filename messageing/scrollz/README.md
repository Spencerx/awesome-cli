ScrollZ is advanced IRC client based on ircII code. It adds features
 normally found in ircII scripts like Toolz, PhoEniX, GargOyle or Lice.

 The main difference between these scripts and ScrollZ is the code. Where
 ircII scripts take a lot of disk and memory space and run slow, ScrollZ
 only takes a couple of extra kilobytes compared to stock ircII client yet
 runs faster than any ircII script. This was accomplished by using C code
 instead of ircII scripting language. This reduces memory and CPU usage and
 code tends to run way faster.

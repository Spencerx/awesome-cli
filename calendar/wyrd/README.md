Wyrd acts as an ncurses-based frontend for remind, a scheduler application
 featuring sophisticated date calculation, moon phases, sunrise/sunset,
 Hebrew calendar, alarms, multilingual messages, and proper handling of
 holidays.

 Wyrd displays reminders on a browsable time table along with a calendar
 and lets the user create new timed or untimed reminders. Using the remind
 backend, it is possible to convert the calendar to PostScript for printing
 and to synchronize it with Palm handhelds.

This package contains utilities dos2unix, unix2dos, mac2unix, unix2mac to
 convert the line endings of text files between UNIX (LF), DOS (CRLF) and
 Mac (CR) formats.

 Text files under Windows and DOS typically have two ASCII characters at
 the end of each line: CR (carriage return) followed by LF (line feed).
 Older Macs used just CR, while UNIX uses just LF. While most modern
 editors can read all these formats, there may still be a need to convert
 files between them.

 This is the classic utility developed in 1989.

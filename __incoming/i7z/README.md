i7z reports Intel Core i7, i5, i3 CPU information about Turbo Boost,
 frequencies, multipliers, ... and comes top-like display showing per core the
 current frequency, temperature and times spent in the C0/C1/C3/C6/C7 states.

 There is also an i7z_rw_registers script that allows toggling Turbo mode
 or set multipliers.

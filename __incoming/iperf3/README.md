# iperf3

* Homepage: http://software.es.net/iperf

Iperf3 is a tool for performing network throughput measurements. It can
 test either TCP or UDP throughput.

 This is a new implementation that shares no code with the original
 iperf from NLANR/DAST and also is not backwards compatible.

 This package contains the command line utility.

CPUburn is a collection of programs to put heavy stress on CPU. These
 programs are designed to load CPUs as heavily as possible for the purposes
 of system testing.

 Warning: The goal has been to maximize heat production from the CPU,
 putting stress on the CPU itself, cooling system, motherboard. This may
 cause data loss (filesystem corruption) and possibly permanent damage to
 electronic components. Use at your own risk.

Slrn is a threaded news reader with color support that is designed to
 read news fast over slow links.

 Slrn can read usenet news via NNTP or directly from a local news spool.

 Slrn can be heavily customized from its rc file, and even includes a
 built in macro language. There is also support for killfiles and
 article scoring.

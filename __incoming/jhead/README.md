jhead is a command line driven utility for extracting digital camera
 settings from the Exif format files used by many digital cameras. It
 handles the various confusing ways these can be expressed, and displays
 them as F-stop, shutter speed, etc. It is also able to reduce the size of
 digital camera JPEGs without loss of information, by deleting integral
 thumbnails that digital cameras put into the Exif header.

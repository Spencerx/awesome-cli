# rkhunter

* Homepage: http://rkhunter.sourceforge.net/

Rootkit Hunter scans systems for known and unknown rootkits, backdoors,
 sniffers and exploits.

 It checks for:
  - MD5 hash changes;
  - files commonly created by rootkits;
  - executables with anomalous file permissions;
  - suspicious strings in kernel modules;
  - hidden files in system directories;
  and can optionally scan within files.

 Using rkhunter alone does not guarantee that a system is not compromised.
 Running additional tests, such as chkrootkit, is recommended.

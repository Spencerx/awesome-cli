Tpp stands for text presentation program and is an ncurses-based
 presentation tool. The presentation can be written with your favorite
 editor in a simple description format and then shown on any text terminal
 that is supported by ncurses - ranging from an old VT100 to the Linux
 framebuffer to an xterm.

 It supports color, LaTeX output of presentation, sliding in text, a
 command prompt and additional cool features.

# sshuttle

* Homepage: https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle/

Sshuttle makes it possible to access remote networks using SSH. It creates
 a transparent proxy server, using iptables, that will forward all the
 traffic through an SSH tunnel to a remote copy of sshuttle.

 It does not require installation on the remote server, which just needs to
 have python installed.

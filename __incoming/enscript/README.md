GNU Enscript takes ASCII files (often source code) and converts them to
 PostScript, HTML or RTF.  It can store generated output to a file or send
 it directly to the printer.

 It is often used for its syntax highlighting, as it comes with rules for a
 wide range of programming languages.  New rules can be added using an awk-
 like stateful scripting language.

# note

* Homepage: http://www.daemon.de/NOTE

This is a small console program similar to knotes, which allows you to
 manage notes from commandline. Note can use different database-backends
 for notes-storage. It ships with a DBI-based mysql-module (which can also
 be used by others through a DBI-based supported DBMS) and another module,
 which uses a binary file for storage and a DBM module.

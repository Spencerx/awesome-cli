# hnb

* Homepage: http://hnb.sourceforge.net/

Hnb is an ncurses program to organize many kinds of data in one place, for
 example addresses, todo lists, ideas, book reviews or to store snippets of
 brainstorming, to make a structured packing list or just to take random
 notes. It can export ascii, html and xml, supports todo checkboxes,
 checkbox trees with percentages, priorities, preferences, searching and
 more.

 Hnb is orphaned upstream. Though the current Debian maintainer tries to
 keep hnb in a usable and releasable state he does not plan to add many new
 features. If you are interested in hnb and want to become its new upstream
 maintainer please contact the original author and the Debian maintainer.

 Hnb does currently not support UTF-8.

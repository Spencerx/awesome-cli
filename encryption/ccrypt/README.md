# ccrypt

* Homepage: http://ccrypt.sourceforge.net

ccrypt is a utility for encrypting and decrypting files and streams. It
 was designed as a replacement for the standard unix crypt utility, which
 is notorious for using a very weak encryption algorithm. ccrypt is based
 on the Rijndael cipher, which is the U.S. government's chosen candidate
 for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES, see http://www.nist.gov/aes).
 This cipher is believed to provide very strong security.

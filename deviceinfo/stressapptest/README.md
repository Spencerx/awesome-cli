Stressful Application Test (or stressapptest, its unix name) tries to
 maximize randomized traffic to memory from processor and I/O, with the
 intent of creating a realistic high load situation in order to test the
 existing hardware devices in a computer.

 Stressapptest may be used for various purposes:

  * stress test
  * hardware qualification and debugging
  * memory interface test
  * disk testing

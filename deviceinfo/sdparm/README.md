The sdparm utility outputs and in some cases modifies SCSI device
 parameters. It can be used to output and modify parameters on any device
 that uses a SCSI command set. Apart from SCSI disks, such devices include
 CD/DVD drives (irrespective of transport), SCSI and ATAPI tape drives and
 SCSI enclosures.

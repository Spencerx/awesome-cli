This file is a template for new entries.

Copy this file to a new folder, where the folder is named after the tool you
want to add, name this file README.md.

If you have to list code in this file, don't do it in the "Description"
section. If it is more than 15 lines, it would be nice to put it into an own
file next to the README.md file and refer to it.

Remove this note before committing.

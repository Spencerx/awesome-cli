The Sleuth Kit (previously known as TASK) is a collection of UNIX-based
 command line file and volume system forensic analysis tools. The file
 system tools allow you to examine file systems of a suspect computer in a
 non-intrusive fashion. Because the tools do not rely on the operating
 system to process the file systems, deleted and hidden content is shown.

 The volume system (media management) tools allow you to examine the layout
 of disks and other media. The Sleuth Kit supports DOS partitions, BSD
 partitions (disk labels), Mac partitions, Sun slices (Volume Table of
 Contents), and GPT disks. With these tools, you can identify where
 partitions are located and extract them so that they can be analyzed with
 file system analysis tools.

 This package contains the set of command line tools in The Sleuth Kit.

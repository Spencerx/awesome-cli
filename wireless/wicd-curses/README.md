Wicd is a general-purpose network configuration server which aims
 to provide a simple but flexible interface for connecting to networks.
 Its features include:

  * wide variety of settings;
  * ability to connect to (and maintain profiles for) both wired and
    wireless networks;
  * support for many encryption schemes, including WEP, WPA, WPA2 and
    custom schemes;
  * wireless-tools compatibility.

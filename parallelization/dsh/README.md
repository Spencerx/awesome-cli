# dsh

* Homepage: http://dsh.sourceforge.net/

Executes specified command on a group of computers using remote shell
 methods such as rsh or ssh.

 dsh can parallelise job submission using several algorithms, such as using
 fan-out method or opening as much connections as possible, or using a
 window of connections at one time. It also supports "interactive mode" for
 interactive maintenance of remote hosts.

 This tool is handy for administration of PC clusters, and multiple hosts.

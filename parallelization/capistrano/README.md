Capistrano is great for automating tasks via SSH on remote servers, like
 software installation, application deployment, configuration management,
 ad hoc server monitoring, and more. Ideal for system administrators,
 whether professional or incidental. Easy to customize. Its configuration
 files use the Ruby programming language syntax, but you don't need to know
 Ruby to do most things with Capistrano.

 Capistrano is easy to extend. It's written in the Ruby programming
 language, and may be extended easily by writing additional Ruby modules.

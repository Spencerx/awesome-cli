# wdiff

`wdiff' is a front-end to GNU `diff'.  It compares two files, finding
 which words have been deleted or added to the first in order to create
 the second.  It has many output formats and interacts well with
 terminals and pagers (notably with `less').  `wdiff' is particularly
 useful when two texts differ only by a few words and paragraphs have
 been refilled.

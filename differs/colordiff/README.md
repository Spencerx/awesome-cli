# colordiff

* Homepage: http://colordiff.org/

ColorDiff is a wrapper for the 'diff' command. It produces the same output
 as diff, but with colored highlighting to improve readability. The color
 schemes can be customized.

 The output is similar to the syntax-highlighting mode of Vim or Emacs when
 editing a patch created by diff.

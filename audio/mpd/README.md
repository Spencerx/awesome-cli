Music Player Daemon (MPD) is a server that allows remote access for
 playing audio files (Ogg-Vorbis, FLAC, MP3, Wave, and AIFF), streams (Ogg-
 Vorbis, MP3) and managing playlists.  Gapless playback, buffered output,
 and crossfading support is also included.  The design focus is on
 integrating a computer into a stereo system that provides control for
 music playback over a TCP/IP network.  The goals are to be easy to install
 and use, to have minimal resource requirements (it has been reported to
 run fine on a Pentium 75), and to remain stable and flexible.

 The daemon is controlled through a client which need not run on the same
 computer mpd runs on.  The separate client and server design allows users
 to choose a user interface that best suites their tastes independently of
 the underlying daemon (this package) which actually plays music.

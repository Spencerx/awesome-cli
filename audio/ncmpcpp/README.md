# ncmpcpp

* Homepage: http://ncmpcpp.rybczak.net/

ncmpcpp is almost an exact clone of ncmpc which is a text-mode client for
 MPD, the Music Player Daemon. It provides a keyboard oriented and
 consistent interface to MPD and contains some new features ncmpc doesn't
 have. It's been also rewritten from scratch in C++.

 New features include:
  - tag editor;
  - playlists editor;
  - easy to use search screen;
  - media library screen;
  - lyrics screen;
  - possibility of going to any position in currently playing track
    without rewinding/fastforwarding;
  - multi colored main window (if you want);
  - songs can be added to playlist more than once;
  - a lot of minor useful functions.

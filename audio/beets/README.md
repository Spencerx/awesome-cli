Beets is a media library management system for obsessive-compulsive music
 geeks.

 The purpose of beets is to get your music collection right once and for
 all. It catalogs your collection, automatically improving its metadata as
 it goes using the MusicBrainz database.  It then provides a set of tools
 for manipulating and accessing your music.

 Beets also includes a music player that implements the MPD protocol, so
 you can play music in your beets library using any MPD client.

# hledger

* Homepage: http://hledger.org/

hledger is a Haskell port and friendly fork of John Wiegley's ledger
 accounting tool. This package provides the main hledger command-line tool;
 see the other hledger-* packages for web and curses interfaces and chart
 generation. hledger aims to be a reliable, practical financial reporting
 tool for day-to-day use, and also a useful library for building financial
 apps in haskell. Given a plain text file describing transactions, of money
 or any other commodity,

 hledger will print the chart of accounts, account balances, or
 transactions you're interested in. It can also help you add transactions
 to the journal file, or convert CSV data from your bank.

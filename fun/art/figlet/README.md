Figlet (Frank, Ian & Glenn's Letters) is a program that creates large
 characters out of ordinary screen characters.

 It can create characters in many different styles and can kern and "smush"
 these characters together in various ways.  Figlet output is generally
 reminiscent of the sort of "signatures" many people like to put at the end
 of e-mail, Usenet and MOTD messages.

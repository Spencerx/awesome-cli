* Homepage: http://crawl.develz.org/

Crawl is a fun game in the grand tradition of games like Rogue, Hack, and
 Moria. Your objective is to travel deep into a subterranean cave complex
 and retrieve the Orb of Zot, which is guarded by many horrible and hideous
 creatures.

 This is the console version, for tiles, use crawl-tiles instead.

 This is the Stone Soup version of Dungeon Crawl.

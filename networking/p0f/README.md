p0f performs passive OS detection based on SYN packets. Unlike nmap and
 queso, p0f does recognition without sending any data. Additionally, it is
 able to determine the distance to the remote host, and can be used to
 determine the structure of a foreign or local network. When running on the
 gateway of a network it is able to gather huge amounts of data and provide
 useful statistics. On a user-end computer it could be used as powerful IDS
 add-on. p0f supports full tcpdump-style filtering expressions, and has an
 extensible and detailed fingerprinting database.

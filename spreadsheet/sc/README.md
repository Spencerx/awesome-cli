"Spreadsheet Calculator" is a much modified version of the public- domain
 spread sheet sc, which was posted to Usenet several years ago by Mark
 Weiser as vc, originally by James Gosling. It is based on rectangular
 table much like a financial spreadsheet.

 Its keybindings are familiar to users of 'vi', and it has most features
 that a pure spreadsheet would, but lacks things like graphing and saving
 in foreign formats.  It's very stable and quite easy to use once you've
 put a little effort into learning it.

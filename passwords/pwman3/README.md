Pwman3 aims to provide a simple but powerful command line interface for
 password management. It allows one to store your password in a sqlite
 database locked by a master password which can be encrypted with different
 algorithms (e.g Blowfish, AES, DES3).

 It is also possible to tag them to ease searches in a large amount of
 passwords

GNU Midnight Commander is a text-mode full-screen file manager. It uses a
 two panel interface and a subshell for command execution. It includes an
 internal editor with syntax highlighting and an internal viewer with
 support for binary files. Also included is Virtual Filesystem (VFS), that
 allows files on remote systems (e.g. FTP, SSH servers) and files inside
 archives to be manipulated like real files.

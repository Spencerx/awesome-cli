FD (FD represents "File and Directory") is an easy-to-use file management
 tool for Un*x newbies.  As its name shows, this is a rewrite from scratch
 - the original version was written by Atsushi Idei for MS-DOS(tm) and once
 very popular in Japan. Messages are available either in English or in
 Japanese.

Ranger is a free console file manager that gives you greater flexibility
 and a good overview of your files without having to leave your *nix
 console. It visualizes the directory tree in two dimensions: the directory
 hierarchy on one, lists of files on the other, with a preview to the right
 so you know where you'll be going.

 The default keys are similar to those of Vim, Emacs and Midnight
 Commander, though Ranger is easily controllable with just the arrow keys
 or the mouse.

 The program is written in Python and uses curses for the text-based user
 interface.

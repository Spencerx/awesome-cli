CDargs is a tool which enhances the navigation of the common unix file-
 system inside the shell. It plugs into the shell built-in cd-command (via
 a shell function or an  alias) and adds bookmarks and a browser to it.

 It enables you to move to a very distant place in the file-system with
 just a few keystrokes.

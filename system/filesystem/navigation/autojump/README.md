# autojump

* Homepage: https://github.com/wting/autojump/

autojump provides a faster way to navigate your filesystem, with a "cd
 command that learns".

 It works by maintaining a database of the directories you use the most
 from the command line, and allows you to "jump" to frequently used
 directories by typing only a small pattern.

 To use autojump, you need to configure your shell to source
 /usr/share/autojump/autojump.sh on startup.

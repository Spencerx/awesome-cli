# shake

* Homepage: http://vleu.net/shake/

The shake utility is a simple and transparent test engine for Lua.

 Shake gives concise reports when the tests succeed, while it prints
 detailed traces when tests fail.

 Regular Lua test files, if written using only standard assert and print
 calls, can be run with shake with no modifications.

 This package contains the shake command line utility, the Lua modules that
 implement shake functionalities and the documentation for both.

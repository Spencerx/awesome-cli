FSlint is a toolkit to clean filesystem lint. It includes a GTK+ GUI as
 well as a command line interface and can be used to reclaim disk space. It
 has an interface for uninstalling packages, and it can find things like:

    - Duplicate files
    - Problematic filenames
    - Temporary files
    - Bad symlinks
    - Empty directories
    - Nonstripped binaries

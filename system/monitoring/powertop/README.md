PowerTOP is a Linux tool to diagnose issues with power consumption and
 power management. In addition to being a diagnostic tool, PowerTOP also
 has an interactive mode you can use to experiment with various power
 management settings, for cases where the Linux distribution has not
 enabled those settings.

 PowerTOP reports which components in the system are most likely to blame
 for higher-than-needed power consumption, ranging from software
 applications to active components in the system. Detailed screens are
 available for CPU C and P states, device activity, and software activity.

# bosh

* Homepage: http://bosh.sourceforge.net/

bosh stands for browsable output shell. This is a bit of a misnomer
 because it isn't really a shell. What is does is store the output of a
 specified program in a buffer, and provides a simple curses interface to
 browse this buffer. Actions can be configured which can make use of the
 contents of the currently selected line.

 Commands and actions are stored in bosh configuration files. These can
 include shebang line (#!/usr/bin/bosh) so that the configuration can just
 be run from the command-line.

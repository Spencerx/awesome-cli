* Homepage: http://nmon.sourceforge.net

nmon is a systems administrator, tuner, benchmark tool. It can display the
 CPU, memory, network, disks (mini graphs or numbers), file systems, NFS,
 top processes, resources (Linux version & processors) and on Power micro-
 partition information.

 Data is displayed on the screen and updated once every two seconds, using
 a dumb screen. However, you can easily change this interval to a longer or
 shorter time period.

 The nmon tool can also capture the same data to a text file for later
 analysis and graphing for reports. The output is in a spreadsheet format
 (.csv).

Dstat is a versatile replacement for vmstat, iostat and ifstat. Dstat
 overcomes some of the limitations of these programs and adds some extra
 features.

 Dstat allows you to view all of your network resources instantly, you can
 for example, compare disk usage in combination with interrupts from your
 IDE controller, or compare the network bandwidth numbers directly with the
 disk throughput (in the same interval).

 Dstat also cleverly gives you the most detailed information in columns and
 clearly indicates in what magnitude and unit the output is displayed.

 Dstat is also unique in letting you aggregate block device throughput for
 a certain diskset or network bandwidth for a group of interfaces, i.e. you
 can see the throughput for all the block devices that make up a single
 filesystem or storage system.

 Dstat's output, in its current form, is not suited for post-processing by
 other tools, it's mostly meant for humans to interpret real-time data as
 easy as possible.

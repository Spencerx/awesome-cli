Atop is an ASCII full-screen performance monitor, similar to the top
 command, but atop only shows the active system-resources and processes,
 and only shows the deviations since the previous interval.  At regular
 intervals, it shows system-level activity related to the CPU, memory,
 swap, disks and network layers, and it shows for every active process the
 CPU utilization in system and user mode, the virtual and resident memory
 growth, priority, username, state, and exit code. The process level
 activity is also shown for processes which finished during the last
 interval, to get a complete overview about the consumers of things such as
 CPU time.

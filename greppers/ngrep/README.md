* Homepage: http://ngrep.sourceforge.net/

ngrep strives to provide most of GNU grep's common features, applying them
 to the network layer.  ngrep is a pcap-aware tool that will allow you to
 specify extended regular expressions to match against data payloads of
 packets.  It currently recognizes TCP, UDP and ICMP across Ethernet, PPP,
 SLIP and null interfaces, and understands bpf filter logic in the same
 fashion as more common packet sniffing tools, such as tcpdump and snoop.

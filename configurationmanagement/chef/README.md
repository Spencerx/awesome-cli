Chef is a systems integration framework and configuration management library
 written in Ruby. Chef provides a Ruby library and API that can be used to
 bring the benefits of configuration management to an entire infrastructure.

 Chef can be run as a client (chef-client) to a server, or run as a standalone
 tool (chef-solo). Configuration recipes are written in a pure Ruby DSL.

 This package contains the chef-client, chef-solo and knife binaries as well
 as the chef library.

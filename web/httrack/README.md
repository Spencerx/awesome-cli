HTTrack is an offline browser utility, allowing you to download a World
 Wide website from the Internet to a local directory, building recursively
 all directories, getting html, images, and other files from the server to
 your computer.

 HTTrack arranges the original site's relative link-structure. Simply open
 a page of the "mirrored" website in your browser, and you can browse the
 site from link to link, as if you were viewing it online. HTTrack can also
 update an existing mirrored site, and resume interrupted downloads.
 HTTrack is fully configurable, and has an integrated help system.

# transmission-cli

* Homepage: http://www.transmissionbt.com/

Transmission is a set of lightweight BitTorrent clients (in GUI, CLI
 and daemon form). All its incarnations feature a very simple, intuitive
 interface on top on an efficient, cross-platform back-end.

 This package contains a (deprecated) stand-alone command-line client,
 transmission-remote to interface with transmission-daemon and tools to
 create, edit and inspect torrent files.

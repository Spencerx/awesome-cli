* Homepage: http://knackered.org/angus/psutils/

This collection of utilities is for manipulating PostScript
 documents.  Page selection and rearrangement are supported, including
 arrangement into signatures for booklet printing, and page merging
 for n-up printing.

 The following programs are included in psutils: epsffit, extractres,
 fixdlsrps, fixfmps, fixmacps, fixpsditps, fixpspps, fixscribeps,
 fixtpps, fixwfwps, fixwpps, fixwwps, getafm, includeres, psbook,
 psmerge, psnup, psresize, psselect, pstops, showchar

 Some programs included here (psmerge) behave differently if gs is
 available, but all programs work without it.

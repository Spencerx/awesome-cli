dtrx is basically the same as tar -zxf or tar -xjf except you don't have
 to remember the flags for each file. But there's more to it than that. You
 know those really annoying files that don't put everything in a dedicated
 directory, and have the permissions all wrong? dtrx takes care of all
 those problems for you, too. dtrx is simple and powerful. Just use the
 same command for all your archive files, and they'll never frustrate you
 again.

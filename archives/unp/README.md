# unp

unp is a small perl script which makes extraction of any archive files a
 bit easier. It support several compressors and archiver programs, chooses
 the right one(s) automatically and extracts one or more files in one go.

 You may also want to install some non-free packages like "unace-nonfree",
 "unrar-nonfree" and "lha" to extract archives of these types.

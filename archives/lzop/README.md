lzop is a compressor similar to gzip.  Its main advantages over gzip are much higher compression and decompression speed.  lzop was designed with the following goals in mind:
  1) reliability
  2) speed (both compression and decompression)
  3) reasonable drop-in compatibility with gzip
  4) portability

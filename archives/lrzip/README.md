# lrzip

* Homepage: http://lrzip.kolivas.org/

A compression program that can achieve very high compression ratios and
 speed when used with large files. It uses the combined compression
 algorithms of zpaq and lzma for maximum compression, lzo for maximum
 speed, and the long range redundancy reduction of rzip. It is designed to
 scale with increases with RAM size, improving compression further. A
 choice of either size or speed optimizations allows for either better
 compression than even lzma can provide, or better speed than gzip, but
 with bzip2 sized compression levels.

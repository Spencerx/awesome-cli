p7zip is the Unix command-line port of 7-Zip, a file archiver that
 archives with high compression ratios.

 p7zip provides:
  - /usr/bin/7zr
    a standalone minimal version of the 7-zip tool that only handles
    7z archives. 7z compression is 30-50% better than ZIP compression.
  - /usr/bin/p7zip
    a gzip-like wrapper around 7zr.

 p7zip can be used with popular compression interfaces (such as File Roller
 or Nautilus).

 p7zip-full provides 7z and 7za which support more compression formats.

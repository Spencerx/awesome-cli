GNU Screen is a terminal multiplexer that runs several separate "screens" on
 a single physical character-based terminal. Each virtual terminal emulates a
 DEC VT100 plus several ANSI X3.64 and ISO 2022 functions. Screen sessions
 can be detached and resumed later on a different terminal.

 Screen also supports a whole slew of other features, including configurable
 input and output translation, serial port support, configurable logging,
 and multi-user support.

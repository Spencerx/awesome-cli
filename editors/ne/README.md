Ne, the nice editor, is one of the few text editors being both easy to use
 for the beginner and powerful enough for the wizard, supporting UTF-8 and
 multi-column characters as well as syntax highlighting.

 It uses short, intuitive and easy to remember key bindings while providing
 all the features an editor should have. It is fully configurable allowing
 the user to change the content of the various menus, to easily create
 small macros and to easily change the existing key bindings while being a
 small and fast editor.

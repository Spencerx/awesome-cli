This program is intended to be a small, fast, and portable editor for
 people who can't (or don't want to) run real Emacs for one reason or
 another.  It is compatible with GNU because there shouldn't be any reason
 to learn more than one Emacs flavor.

 Packages which provide editors with broadly similar goals include

   * e3;
   * joe;
   * jove and xjove;
   * ng-cjk, ng-cjk-canna and ng-latin;
   * qemacs and qemacs-nox; and
   * zile

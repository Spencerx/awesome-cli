# units

* Homepage: http://gnu.org/software/units/

GNU 'units' program converts quantities expressed in various scales
 to their equivalents in other scales.  The 'units' program can only
 handle multiplicative scale changes directly.  It uses a functional
 notation for "nonlinear" conversions such a Fahrenheit temperature
 to Celsius temperature.

 This package includes the units_cur script to update currency
 conversion information; this script requires a Python interpreter.

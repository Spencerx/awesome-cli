* Homepage: http://www.gnu.org/software/bc/

GNU bc is an interactive algebraic language with arbitrary precision which
 follows the POSIX 1003.2 draft standard, with several extensions including
 multi-character variable names, an `else' statement and full Boolean
 expressions.  GNU bc does not require the separate GNU dc program.

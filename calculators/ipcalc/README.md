# ipcalc

* Homepage: http://jodies.de/ipcalc

ipcalc takes an IPv4 address and netmask and calculates the resulting
 broadcast, network, Cisco wildcard mask, and host range. By giving a
 second netmask, you can design sub- and supernetworks. It is also intended
 to be a teaching tool and presents the results as easy-to-understand
 binary values.

 Originally, ipcalc was intended for use from the shell prompt, but a CGI
 wrapper is provided to enable colorful HTML display through a webserver.

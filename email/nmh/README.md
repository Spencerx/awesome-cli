# nmh

This is the nmh mail user agent (reader/sender), a command-line based mail
 reader that is powerful and extensible.  nmh is an excellent choice for
 people who receive and process a lot of mail.

 Unlike most mail user agents, nmh is not a single program, rather it is a
 set of programs that are run from the shell.  This allows the user to
 utilize the full power of the Unix shell in coordination with nmh.
 Various front-ends are available, such as mh-e (an emacs mode), xmh, and
 exmh (X11 clients).

 nmh was originally based on MH version 6.8.3, and is intended to be a
 (mostly) compatible drop-in replacement for MH.
